The 2020 European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020) is the top European conference in the image analysis area.

Extremely grateful to Google Research for giving me a complimentary delegate pass to attend @eccvconf! 
This time as a delegate, next time hope to participate as a speaker at the European Conference on Computer Vision!
