How quickly get into the Game Development: books, documentaries, podcasts?

Not so far, I’m working in the game industry, so I learned a lot of information from different sources just for getting into the industry and here best of them.

1.1 A book about creating games: ["Blood, Sweat and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made"](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Pixels-Triumphant-Turbulent-ebook/dp/B01NAKSWW1) by Jason Schreier" (about "The Witcher 3", "Diablo 3", "Destiny")

The book is well written, full of nifty details about the industry that feel refreshing and eye opening at how videogames are made from a production standpoint. Taking ten games, ranging from indie-darlings to the most-high profile games made in the last decade, author investigates the prouction process to determine what does it take to make a hit game. Written as a series of exemplars, Jason Schreir highlights how each game's developmnet is different but experience common challenges.

It's not a technical/geeky book, so if you're into the nuts-and-bolts of writing games or how to develop a game, this isn't the book for you. It's pretty high level and while quite interesting as to how these gaming companies managed to release their games, there's nothing that exciting here.

1.2 Documentary series about the early history of video games from Netflix- ["High Score"](https://www.netflix.com/kg/title/81019087). There are six episode docuseries covering gaming from stand-up arcade cabinets of the late '70s and early '80s to the move to 3D graphics for home consoles and personal computers in the early 1990s, almost all of High Score's episodes are divided into separate parts that broadly cover the topic of the episode (role-playing games, for example) while also showing side stories of personal connections to gaming, which, because of their specificity, tend to be the highlights of the episode.
