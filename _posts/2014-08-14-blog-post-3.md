1. [Machine Learning Yearning](https://www.dbooks.org/machine-learning-yearning-1501/) by Andrew Ng. Artificial Intelligence is transforming numerous industries. Machine Learing Yaerning, a free ebook from Andrew Ng, teaches you how to structure Machine Learning projects.
This book is focused not on teaching you ML algorithms, but on how to make ML algorithms work. After reading Machine Learning Yearning, you will be able to:
- Prioritize the most promising directions for an AI project
- Diagnose errors in a machine learning system
- Build ML in complex settings, such as mismatched training/ test sets
- Set up an ML project to compare to and/or surpass human- level performance
- Know when and how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

2. [Statistical Inference for Data Science](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25335251-statistical-inference-for-data-science) by Brian Caffo
Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. 
There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, 
data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses.
This book gives a brief, but rigorous, treatment of statistical inference intended for practicing Data Scientists.

3. [Think Stats](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Stats-Allen-B-Downey/dp/1449307116) by Allen B.Downey
  This concise introduction shows you how to perform statistical analysis computationally, rather than mathematically, with programs written in Python.
  You'll work with a case study throughout the book to help you learn the entire data analysis processâ€”from collecting data and generating statistics to identifying patterns and testing hypotheses. Along the way, you'll become familiar with distributions, the rules of probability, visualization, and many other tools and concepts.
  
  
4. [Understanding Machine Learning: From theory to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Machine-Learning-Theory-Algorithms-ebook/dp/B00J8LQU8I) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. 

5. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576)
  By Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman
  
  
6. [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Data-Science-Avrim-Blum/dp/1108485065) By Avrim Blum, John Hopcroft, and Ravindran Kannan










The list of books always will be increased. Stay tuned!
