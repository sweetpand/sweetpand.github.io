What is TechWomen?

TechWomen is an Initiative of the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs.

TechWomen empowers, connects and supports the next generation of women leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) from Africa, Central and South Asia, and the Middle East by providing them the access and opportunity needed to advance their careers, pursue their dreams, and inspire women and girls in their communities.

Through mentorship and exchange, TechWomen strengthens participants’ professional capacity, increases mutual understanding between key networks of professionals, and expands girls’ interest in STEM careers by exposing them to female role models.

The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the country participants of the TechWomen, and each year the program is selected 5-6 women in STEM fields who actively demonstrate pursue in their professional and social sphere. After all selection process the top 100 finalists of the program from 22 countries of participants becoming the Fellows of the TechWomen program and get a chance to be interned at tech giant companies in Silicon Valley. I want to point out that the fellows don't have the privilege to choose the company to be interned in, the program has its own algorithm for match the fellows with companies basing on the surveys you fill in and what sphere you are interested in mostly. Before heading to Silicon Valley, the program will solve and cover a bunch of logistic and any other program-related issues, starting from your food preferences and ending your visa issues. 
As you understand when you selected by program, eligibilities you can look here, the only question that you should worry is ‘what you want to learn/get from this program?’ and highlight your personal and professional takeaways.

I was lucky enough to be interned at Head Quarter of [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) company under the supervision of Stephany Lucas, Sarah Yu, and Swetha Surapaneni. My mentors were so kind and highly welcomed me at the company and help me to deep dive into everything during the whole internship. The main thing they did for me is they put the relationship before the mentorship. They even visited the final wrap-up events in Washington, DC and the also visited Kyrgyz Republic Embassy in Washington with me.

As many leadership programs as well in TechWomen also have a competition, competition for the best project for your country.  That’s why most of the time you will collaborate with your team from your county and your team coaches with different professional background. Most coaches for your teams are specialized for start-ups, entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. The goal of the team-work and collaboration with the mentors and coaches  are a seed grant for winners of the best three projects. On final day, all teams from 22-countries will present their projects for the independent jury and they will chose the winners. The seed grant can give that teams to start realizing winners projects in their country.  As TechWomen is a STEM oriented program, most of the projects which initiated by our Fellows are related STEM field. 

Highlights of the program

After all teams arrived to the Bay Area, the program will start with amazing event which is called Cultural Day. At this day all teams will present their country team by showing their culture and traditional things. My forever lovely event! Our team prepared a national dance and we were dressed on national dresses. I was amazing!
