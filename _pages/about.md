I’m Zhama Ryskulova, a Software Engineer in Machine Learning mostly working on computer vision tasks.

I have graduated with Software Engineering in my bachelor’s and getting Statistics in my master’s degrees. Since when I was a sophomore I am working in the industry as a Software Engineer. I started my journey as an Android Developer and grow up until the Software Engineer in Machine Learning.

My industrial journey started at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/), as an intern, where I worked on the different versions of internal mobile applications. Then I interned at [Zensoft](https://www.zensoft.io/) as both frontend and backend engineer where I have implemented the semantic algorithm for the HR platform. The implemented algorithm was deployed on production and I hope it is still in production. Then I interned at [ARLOOPA](https://arloopa.com/) as a backed and data engineer at the machine learning team I have been worked with both structured and unstructured data and prepare data for machine learning models. Then I was selected for the [TechWomen](https://www.techwomen.org/) program right after the graduation of my bachelor's in 2018 and I was fortunate to get an internship at HQ of [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), I was part of the data and AI experimental team.

Currently, I am working for [Unity](https://unity.com/), a rockstar company in the Game Development industry. At Unity, as a Software Engineer in Machine Learning, I implement various computer vision algorithms to make our image recognition engine more powerful and robust.

Apart from my professional life, I am a board member and community lead at HackerSpace Central Asia. We are organizing and hosting hundreds of talks, study sessions, and discussions related to Machine Learning and Computer Science. The hackerSpace is a community of around 3,000 engineers and researchers from all over the world. There are multiple very cool projects initiated by our space. 

I am also dealing with a community-driven pro-bono project supported by UNESCO oriented for Central Asian countries.

I'm an active member of the global women in the tech community and thrilled to close the gender gap and to help women embrace technology. I passionate about the idea to educate, equip and empower women and girls with the necessary skills and confidence to succeed in STEM career fields.

I also start to journey in the machine learning research field as I'm doing a master's there are a lot of requirements to do researches and now my research interests mainly focus on developing data-efficient deep learning models. I do care about data efficiency because I believe we need to push the current deep learning algorithms towards less data dependency. I think this is important for both robustness (introducing general inductive biases) and applicability in different domains.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read about me and please feel free to reach out with anything you have in mind!
