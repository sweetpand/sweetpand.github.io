I help companies predict results based on incoming data by conducting proper research.

Our team and especially my goal is to make a sense of all the data that we have in our company and mold it into a fashion that is useful for our future tasks to apply machine learning on top of.

In short, delivering algorithmic solutions all the way from the concept level to production.

Our tasks are mostly dedicated to solving retail logistic issues tasks like;
-recommendation/order system
-dynamic pricing
-inventory prediction
-demand forecasting
-customer segmentation/targeting
-product bundling

My job actually consists of all lifecycles of our pipeline starting from data acquisition and understanding, collecting, cleaning all of them. The next step is feature engineering, which is included two parts of modeling which are building model and model evaluation. The next step is a deployment part of the model(this part is required a deep understanding of different deployment strategies). Last but not least of my time I'm spending with serving, monitoring, and maintenance of the model.

In practice, the most interesting important part is we build models that classify a given customer as valuable according to the analysis of the digital behavior of the customers. These signals are what is meant by ‘handcrafted features’, and include for our customer demographics, purchase history, returns history, and web and app session logs.
